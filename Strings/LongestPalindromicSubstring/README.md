# Longest Palindromic Substring

Write a function that, given a string, returns its longest palindromic substring.
A palindrome is defined as a string that's written the same forward and backward. 
Note that single-character strings are palindromes.

You can assume that there will only be one longest palindromic substring.

## Sample Input
string = "abaxyzzyxf"

## Sample Output
"xyzzyx"

## Hints

### Hint 1
Try generating all possible substrings of the input string and checking for their palindromicity. 
What is the runtime of the isPalindrome check? What is the total runtime of this approach?

### Hint 2
Recognize that a palindrome is a string that is symmetrical with respect to its center, which can either 
be a character (in the case of odd-length palindromes) or an empty string (in the case of even-length palindromes). 
Thus, you can check the palindromicity of a string by simply expanding from its center and making sure that characters 
on both sides are indeed mirrored.

### Hint 3
Traverse the input string, and at each index, apply the logic mentioned in Hint #2. 
What does this accomplish? Is the runtime of this approach better?

## Optimal Space & Time Complexity
O(n^2) time | O(n) space - where n is the length of the input string
