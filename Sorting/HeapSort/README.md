# Heap Sort

Write a function that takes in an array of integers and returns a sorted 
version of that array. Use the Heap Sort algorithm to sort the array.

If you're unfamiliar with Heap Sort, we recommend watching the Conceptual 
Overview section of this question's video explanation before starting to code.

## Sample Input
array = [8, 5, 2, 9, 5, 6, 3]

## Sample Output
[2, 3, 5, 5, 6, 8, 9]


## Hints
### Hint 1
Divide the input array into two subarrays in place. The second subarray should 
be sorted at all times and should start with a length of 0, while the first 
subarray should be transformed into a max (or min) heap and should satisfy 
the heap property at all times.

### Hint 2
Note that the largest (or smallest) value of the heap should be at the very 
beginning of the newly-built heap. Start by swapping this value with the last 
value in the heap; the largest (or smallest) value in the array should now be 
in its correct position in the sorted subarray, which should now have a length 
of 1; the heap should now be one element smaller, with its first element out of 
place. Apply the "sift down" method of the heap to re-position this out-of-place 
value.

### Hint 3
Repeat the step mentioned in Hint #2 until the heap is left with only one value, 
at which point the entire array should be sorted.

## Optimal Space & Time Complexity
Best: O(nlog(n)) time | O(1) space - where n is the length of the input array
Average: O(nlog(n)) time | O(1) space - where n is the length of the input array
Worst: O(nlog(n)) time | O(1) space - where n is the length of the input array
